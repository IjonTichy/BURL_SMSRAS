QUACKGUI:

 -  Model support (LAST PRIORITY, SHIT LOOKS HARD YO)

 -  Total invisibility from Partial Invisibility pickup, complete with Quake III announcer

CHANGES FROM QUAKE:
 -  Quake had such a lower damage scale than Doom it wasn't even funny. The Vore had 400 HP, equivalent to two Centaurs. In co-op, his weapons have been buffed the fuck out.

 -  The Quad Damage is now a reuseable item, partly to help with the aforementioned damage issues, and partly because there was no appropriate item to replace it with. (Berserks didn't work--too rare, too erratically placed, not to mention should be more utility)

 -  The Double-Barreled Shotgun uses only one shell instead of two due to the aforementioned much lower damage radio.

 -  In Quake, the projectiles had no hitbox. Here, their hitbox is simply obscenely tiny.

 -  Gravity has been ever-so-slightly reduced so as to simulate Quake's strange air physics.

 -  The nails and rockets originally travelled at the same speed. Here, Nails have been increased to speed 75.

 -  Lava Nails, Multi-Grenades, and Multi-Rockets were handled a bit differently. There were no alt-fires, much less that swapped between weapons, and the ammo pickups were separate.

 -  The Double Barreled Shotgun's, Nailgun's, and Laser Cannon's animations are slightly smoother.

 -  The Shotgun and Double-Barreled Shotgun's damages are random by 1d3, while Quake's damage values were completely static. Turns out people are getting upset for using fake bullets. Whoops.

 -  The trail behind the Nails and Lava Nails has been made a LOT more obvious, so enemies can see it more easily in DM.
