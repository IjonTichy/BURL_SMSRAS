COMPETITIVE SHIT:

- In Last Man Standing, you can adjust the amount of life/armor people start with
  by using the sv_lmslife cvar. sasmara_lmslife 0 starts with just 100 life, using
  sasmara_lmslife 1 starts with 100 life and 100 armor, sasmara_lmslife 2 starts with
  200 life/armor, sasmara_lmslife 3 starts 300 life/armor, sasmara_lmslife 4 starts
  with 400, and sasmara_lmslife 5 starts with 500.
  
- In Last Man Standing, to have characters spawn with Ultimate weapons as well,
  use the sasmara_lmsult cvar. sasmara_lmsult 1 enables Ultimates, sasmara_lmsult 0
  disables it.

- In Last Man Standing, to have characters spawn with their Unique item as well,
  use the samsara_lmsunique cvar. samsara_lmsunique 1 enables, samsara_lmsunique 0
  disables it.



COOPERATIVE SHIT:

- If players aren't being challenged with UV-Fast, please consider using the new
  Skill 4. If you would like to use the old Skill 4, it can be replicated with the
  command lines "skill 3", "sv_monsterrespawn 1", and "sv_fastmonsters 1".

- In co-op, characters can shoot through each other.

- In co-op, characters picking up keys will share it with everyone--you can see
  who got what key in the RCon log.



UNIVERSAL SHIT:

- HeXen's emphasis on platforming requires a higher jumpheight for characters.
  samsara_hexenjump cvar will increase everybody's jumpheight so as to accomodate
  it.

- Please consider disabling Weapon Drop On Death, as with it players will be able
  to pick up and use other characters' weapons.

- You can disable Duke's jetpack with sasmara_banjetpack 1.

- You can tweak whether the Security Officer has Marathon-esque gravity or normal
  gravity with sasmara_sogravity 1 (Doom gravity) or 0 (Marathon gravity).
  
- Weapon VII can be toggled to be persistent or vanish on pickup by sasmara_permault
  1 or 0. 0 has it vanish on pickup, 1 has it stay persistent. Note that it acts
  as a big powerup, so its respawn timer is much longer than others.

- Heretic and HeXen's palettes are different from Doom's, and thus use different
  color ranges, and thus put color splotches in odd places.
  
- Samsara makes use of Scripts 200-225. Levelsets using these script ranges make
  create odd behavior.
