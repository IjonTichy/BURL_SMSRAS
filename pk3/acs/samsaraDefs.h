int ChangelogString =
"FROM 0.29b TO 0.3\n\
========================\n\
GAMEPLAY:\n\
- B.J.'s chaingun gave less ammo on pickup than his Machine Gun. Fixed, now it gives 20 ammo like the Machine Gun does.\n\
- The Quake wiki reveals the lava nails were dealing too much damage. They were not more powerful in DM, they just pierced armor. And they only did 30% extra damage in co-op. Ranger was adjusted accordingly.\n\
- Someone had removed +THRUGHOST on Ranger's nails. They were put back in.\n\
- The Fusion Pistol's shots can no longer be deflected.\n\
- In lieu of Zandronum 1.1.1, Duke's and Ranger's bullets now use FBF_NORANDOM! This gives them wonderful Unlagged compatibility while still being, as in Duke Nukem 3D, completely static about their damage!\n\
- Splitting the Wraithverge into DM modes and coop modes gave it the side effect of being terribly, terribly overpowered. Its damage in deathmatch has been thirded and it speeds up only half as often.\n\
- Timon's Axe now actually uses the damagetype TimonsAxe. \n\
- In lieu of FBF_NORANDOM, Duke Nukem's Explosive Shotgun has been reworked. Damage emphasis has been placed less on the bullets and more on the explosives--the bullets do less damage, while the explosions do more to a wider radius. To accomodate the wider radius, the accuracy has been tightened up as well.\n\
- The Devastators have had their radius increased as well, from 32 to 64, with damage increased from 35 to 48. Duke Nukem's HEIRARCHY OF EXPLOSIVES now goes:\n\
 ^- Pipebombs: Largest radius\n\
 ^- Explosive Shotgun: Most damage\n\
 ^- RPG: Fastest firing\n\
 ^- Devastators: Ultimate\n\
- Parias now only resists 0.375 of Duke's explosives, rather than the 0.25 he does of everyone else.\n\
- Doomguy's, Duke's, Corvus', and Chexter's bullets have been reworked to utilize an frandom-esque spread of projectiles, rather than the static grid. SO's bullets have been kept in a grid pattern, for accuracy to Marathon.\n\
- Chexguy's bullets were originally more accurate to counteract lack of an SSG. Now he has an SSG-esque weapon, which is super-accurate. Why do the other bullets still need to be more accurate? Reverted to a Doom-esque spread level.\n\
- Corvus' staff went through ghosts in Heretic. Now it does here.\n\
- The difficulty settings now have ACSReturn values, for maps with ACS scripts that rely on difficulty settings.\n\
- Here's one that's been around for a long, long time. Possessed Troopers, Sergeants, and Chaingunners couldn't infight with each other. Now they can!\n\
- A new cvar, samsara_noult, has been implemented for DM/CTF/etc play. When enabled, no VIIs will spawn on the battlefield.\n\
- Corvus' Crossbow has been slightly buffed and the Firemace slightly nerfed, changing out the DamageFactor Mace on everything with DamageFactor CorvusCrossbow. The DamageFactor Mace increase was made long, long ago in the early builds when the Firemace was an alternative to the chaingun and the Crossbow was OP. This is no longer the case.\n\
- Tome of Power doubles dealt damage and halves recieved damage. Cooldown reduced further to 200.\n\
\n\
BUGFIXES:\n\
- Duke's left foot kicks with the Mighty Boot no longer do double damage, and Atomic Boot right foot kicks don't do double damage.\n\
- In Strife, apparently the Loremaster door wouldn't open if you had all five splinters? At least, that's what the code said. Fixed.\n\
- The Thunderbolt could not be forced to not recoil. Fixed.\n\
- In rare instances, the S.O.'s pain frames would be replaced with a burning corpse. This has been fixed.\n\
- Pain Elementals can no longer be unzorched by Archviles.\n\
- You may now suicide when invulnerable again.\n\
- Ranger's powerups now properly deplete on death.\n\
- Players could not be telefragged while invulnerable. This has been fixed.\n\
- In rare instances, the IV pickup would be replaced with Duke's Ripper. This has been fixed.\n\
- Ranger should no longer be able to infinitely stack Quad Damage on pickup.\n\
- In crazy instances where you face Lord Snotfolus before he finishes his monologue (?!), getting him in a painstate will no longer permanently lock him in invulnerability.\n\
- Dumb things happened with the Gargoyles' Zorch sequence online. PresidentPeople has fixed all of the dumb things!\n\
- Armors no longer spawn on the field in Last Man Standing mode.\n\
- Ranger's freezedeath graphic was being overwritten by one of his firing frames. No more.\n\
\n\
POLISH:\n\
- Party Mode particles are now spawned less often and disappear faster.\n\
- Sounds and flashes are now done if you lose armor with Marathon-style armor, to indicate when you're hit.\n\
- All fake bullets now go at 320 tics per unit, a slight speed boost.\n\
- Rephrased a few obituaries to be gender-ambiguous.\n\
- The Hectebus' shots now use the HexGreenFire damagetype.\n\
- Ranger's shaft has been given an increase in girth.\n\
- Duke's ricochet sound happened far too often. Now it happens much less often, as proper of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\
- Vanilla animations for Doomguy's Pistol/Chaingun now properly light up the room.\n\
- Duke's Explosive Shotgun's explosions now has the proper Duke Nukem 64 sprites.";
