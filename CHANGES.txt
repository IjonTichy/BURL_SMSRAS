CHANGES FROM BURL TUMD:

- You start with the pistol silencer.
- The chainsaw comes with an assault rifle sweet jesus.
- BURL TUMD takes 30% more damage, to balance his... kind of insane damage output.
- Everyone else does 50% more damage, to match up to BURL TUMD. This, and the above, will probably not apply for deathmatch. Something else will.
- The pistol has been nerfed. Infinite ammo makes the thing far too powerful for a pistol.
- The thrown chainsaw hitbox has been shrunk so that it doesn't immediately hit the ground if you have your back to a wall or you're at a low ceiling.
